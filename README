Digital Bank 3.77 version decomplied with jad
-------------------------------------------

This version is the development environment containing only the decompiled java files. It does not have the deployable part, the JSPs, js, and other web related parts of the application. A deployable format 'AssetBankBase' is also available.


The decompilation process generated some java files with errors. Most of the errors related to JDK5 format are fixed, and changes are logged in to the file AssetBankDecompilation status.

The decompiled code can be used as a reference for further development.
