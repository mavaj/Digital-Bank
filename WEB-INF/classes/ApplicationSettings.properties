# The LDAP property to use as the user's username:
ad-username-property=sAMAccountName

# Generally, you want to leave the ad-distinguished-name-property setting empty, as then the 'NameInNamespace' attribute will be used, which should contain the DN when querying LDAP servers
# However, if this has a value then that attribute of the LDAP object will be used as the distinguishedName, e.g. could use 'distinguishedName' for AD.
ad-distinguished-name-property=

# Generally, you want to leave the ad-email-property setting as 'mail', as this is the standard attribute of a user's email.
# However, you can change this if necessary.

# Generally, you won't want to add a suffix to the email, so leave empty.

# Set to true if your LDAP server supports paged results, in which case AssetBank will retrieve all users

# If set to true, then active directory users need to register before they can use Asset Bank.
# If set to false, then active directory users can use asset bank as soon as synchronisation is done.
# This setting should be chosen BEFORE the first synchronisation.
hide-new-ad-users=false

# Exclusion pattern for active directory users. 
# Set this if you want to exclude usernames of this pattern for non-Active Directory users.
# The pattern should be a standard regular expression - 
# eg, the following example excludes usernames of the form 'Firstname.Secondname'
# ad-username-exclusion-pattern=[a-zA-Z]*\\.[a-zA-Z]*
# OR leave empty for no exlusion.
ad-username-exclusion-pattern=

# The search criteria used to identify users. The following gets all users with a non-null mail attribute (which avoids getting computers, which are also of objectClass 'user').
# Generally, use objectClass=user. Can use, e.g., (&(objectClass=user)(mail=*)) to retrieve objects where mail attribute is not null
ad-user-search-criteria=(&(objectClass=user)(mail=*))

# If users are missing from LDAP should they be hidden in Asset Bank
hide-missing-ldap-users=true

# Generally, the following property should be set to 1 to indicate that all your users are in the same LDAP server.
# However, if you have multiple LDAP servers, containing different sets of users (i.e. not just for back up) then you should set the following property to the number of different LDAP servers you have.

# If the above property is set to 1, you only need to configure the settings in the block 'LDAP Server 1' below:

ad-wms-user-password=password

# The URL(s) of the LDAP server(s). If you want to specify more than one (e.g. if you have a backup server), delimit using the ad-delimiter property (%% by default). If more than one is specified then the application will try to connect to the first, and if that is not available it will try the second, and so on.
ad-ldap-server-url=ldap://192.168.1.111:389

# This should be the node (s) at which you want to start searching for users. If more than one node, delimit using %% (or whatever is specified as the delimiter in the ad-delimiter property):
ad-ldap-base-list=CN=Users,DC=win2000server,DC=local%%CN=Users2,DC=win2000server2,DC=local2

########## End LDAP Server 1 #############

# If you have 2 LDAP servers (different, not backup - see above) then complete the settings below for the second LDAP server.
