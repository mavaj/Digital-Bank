  This JSP is included by search_fields.jsp and should contain the user
  interface for custom, client-specific external search filters.

  The default version of Asset Bank contains this empty version, client-specific
  versions should be included using the manager-config/updater/customise/
  mechanism so that they survive application updates.

  All form fields in this JSP should have their names prefixed with ef_. They
  will be saved in the externalFilterCriteria property of the SearchCriteria
  bean.
