<!-- 
	GROUP ROLE SECURITY FILE:
	
	This file allows you to give groups of users that have certain roles
	access to admin functionality - either in the form of an action url or
	a securedLink (see com.bright.assetbank.application.taglib.SecuredLinkTag)

	This file is only relevant if the use-group-roles setting is set to true in
	ApplicationSettings.properties and roles have been setup in the database 
	(see the Role table). It currently is only available for the following actions...

	/action/exportFromSearch
	/action/exportAssets
	/action/downloadExportFile
	/action/deleteExportedAssets
	/action/viewReportHome
	/action/viewReport
	/action/viewSearchReport
	/action/viewAssetReport
	/action/downloadAssetReport
	/action/downloadSearchReport
	/action/downloadUsageReport

	...to add it to other actions the permission checking for those actions needs 
	to be updated to include the userprofile.checkForRolePermission check (see one
	of the actions listed for examples of this)

	An example structure is shown below (the role's are listed by their identifier
	i.e. to use a role 'test' you have to have a role in the database with
	identifier 'test')
