ad-delimiter=%%

# The LDAP property to use as the user's username. This is usually sAMAccountName for ActiveDirectory and uid for Novell
ad-username-property=sAMAccountName

# Generally, you want to leave the ad-distinguished-name-property setting empty, as then the 'NameInNamespace' attribute will be used, which should contain the DN when querying LDAP servers
# However, if this has a value then that attribute of the LDAP object will be used as the distinguishedName, e.g. could use 'distinguishedName' for AD.
ad-distinguished-name-property=

# Generally, you want to leave the ad-email-property setting as 'mail', as this is the standard attribute of a user's email.
# However, you can change this if necessary.
ad-email-property=mail

# Generally, you won't want to add a suffix to the email, so leave empty.
ad-email-suffix=

# Set to true if your LDAP server supports paged results, in which case AssetBank will retrieve all users
# one page at a time.
# If false, then AssetBank will retrieve as many users as it can (for active directory this is limited to 1000 by default).
# Note: Active Directory usually supports paging, Novell (usually?) doesn't.

# If set to true, then active directory users need to register before they can use Asset Bank.
# If set to false, then active directory users can use asset bank as soon as synchronisation is done.
# This setting should be chosen BEFORE the first synchronisation.
hide-new-ad-users=false

# Exclusion pattern for active directory users. 
# Set this if you want to exclude usernames of this pattern for non-Active Directory users.
# The pattern should be a standard regular expression - 
# eg, the following example excludes usernames of the form 'Firstname.Secondname'
# ad-username-exclusion-pattern=[a-zA-Z]*\\.[a-zA-Z]*
# OR leave empty for no exlusion.
ad-username-exclusion-pattern=

# The search criteria used to identify users, in RFC 2254 syntax (see http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc2254.html).
# The following gets all users with a non-null mail attribute (which avoids getting computers, which are also of objectClass 'user').
# Generally, use objectClass=user. Can use, e.g., (&(objectClass=user)(mail=*)) to retrieve objects where mail attribute is not null
ad-user-search-criteria=(&(objectClass=user)(mail=*))

# If users are missing from LDAP should they be hidden in Asset Bank

# Generally, the following property should be set to 1 to indicate that all your users are in the same LDAP server.

# The URL(s) of the LDAP server(s). If you want to specify more than one (e.g. if you have a backup server), delimit using the ad-delimiter property (%% by default). If more than one is specified then the application will try to connect to the first, and if that is not available it will try the second, and so on.
ad-ldap-server-url=ldap://192.168.1.15:389

# This should be the node (s) at which you want to start searching for users when synchronising. If more than one node, delimit using %% (or whatever is specified as the delimiter in the ad-delimiter property):
ad-ldap-base-list=CN=Users,DC=domain1,DC=bright-interactive,DC=com

# This should be the node (s) at which you want to start searching for users when adding on the fly. If more than one node, delimit using %% (or whatever is specified as the delimiter in the ad-delimiter property):
