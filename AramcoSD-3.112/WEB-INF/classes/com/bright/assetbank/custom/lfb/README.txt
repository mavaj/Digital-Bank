The Incident Lookup Plugin for London Fire relies on the WEB-INF\lib\lfb.jar.

This jar file is created from java code generated from the WSDL document that was provided by the people who
implemented the IMS (Incident Management System) lookup webservice (Moore Stephens - Mike.Weatherley@moorestephens.com).

The most recent copy of the java classes for the jar file can be found in...

\work\projects\Asset Bank\client projects\London Fire Brigade

...in case the jar file needs to be recreated.
