# The LDAP property to use as the user's username:
ad-username-property=sAMAccountName

# Generally, you want to leave the ad-distinguished-name-property setting empty, as then the 'NameInNamespace' attribute will be used, which should contain the DN when querying LDAP servers
# However, if this has a value then that attribute of the LDAP object will be used as the distinguishedName, e.g. could use 'distinguishedName' for AD.

# Generally, you want to leave the ad-email-property setting as 'mail', as this is the standard attribute of a user's email.
# However, you can change this if necessary.

# Generally, you won't want to add a suffix to the email, so leave empty.

# Exclusion pattern for active directory users. 
# Set this if you want to exclude usernames of this pattern for non-Active Directory users.
# The pattern should be a standard regular expression -

# ad-username-exclusion-pattern=[a-zA-Z]*\\.[a-zA-Z]*
# OR leave empty for no exlusion.

# The search criteria used to identify users. The following gets all users with a non-null mail attribute (which avoids getting computers, which are also of objectClass 'user').
# Generally, use objectClass=user. Can use, e.g., (&(objectClass=user)(mail=*)) to retrieve objects where mail attribute is not null
ad-user-search-criteria=(&(objectClass=user)(mail=*))

# Generally, the following property should be set to 1 to indicate that all your users are in the same LDAP server.
# However, if you have multiple LDAP servers, containing different sets of users (i.e. not just for back up) then you should set the following property to the number of different LDAP servers you have.
