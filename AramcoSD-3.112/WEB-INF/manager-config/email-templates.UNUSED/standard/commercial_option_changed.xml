         Assetbank: alteration to request for commercial use of image/s
      </subject>

Dear #username#

IMPORTANT INFORMATION ABOUT YOUR REQUEST FOR COMMERCIAL USE OF IMAGE/S

Your order number: #ordernum#
#assetDetails#

Having assessed your request, and from the additional information you have provided us, we have felt it necessary to change the commercial option you had initially selected from '#oldOption#'  to '#newOption#'. This has resulted in a change of price for the purchase of the image/s.

You can view the change of use by logging into Assetbank, and proceed to the MY PURCHASES - MY ORDERS section. 

If you do not agree with our assessment of your intended use of the image/s, please contact us and we will be happy to discuss it further with you.
